# CLTV-Segmentation
End-to-end Customer Lifetime Value Segmentation Project using RFM Methodologies. RFM was calculated through KMeans Clustering to assign a score of (1-9) to a customer on their recency, frequency, and amount of their purchases, then their total score was used to determine their customer lifetime value segment. Some other initiatives include feature engineering using statistical relevancy through tests such as ANOVA or Chi-Square to limit dimensions. Finally, the model was deployed for batch inference using Streamlit and FastAPI as frontend and backend, respectively.
